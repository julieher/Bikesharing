# Bikesharing

## <u>Project Overview</u>

The purpose of the project is to analyze Citi Bike data in the city of New York in order to make a decision whether the 'bike-sharing' program is a solid business in the city of Des Moines. Tableau will be used in order to create visualizations, dashboards and stories. 

## <u>Results</u>

## <u>Summary</u>

- Most bike rentals occur right before and after regular office hours, at 8:00AM and after 5:00PM. This means that subscribers use Citi Bikes as their transportation from and to work.
- The bikes are mostly used in popular locations such as tourist attractions, businesses, and commerce.
- From the gender breakdown, we can see that most users are male. 
- The bikes are mostly used for short periods of time, mostly less than 30min.
- Bike utilization from 2:00AM to 4:00AM is very low, this time could be used for bike maintenance.
- It would be a good idea to analyse the map locations.
    1. We could have different color or marker to differenciate the type of users (customer or subscriber) on the map.
    2. Additionally, we could have another map showing weekend vs weekday bike usage.
